Hi,
In this repo you can find a CSV file with the gathered data about North Dakota bussinesses.
The data correspond to all active companies whose names start with the letter "X" 
Columns are: 
1. commercial_registered_agent
2. registered_agent
3. owners
4. id
5. status (allways active)

Also, I included a graph where the nodes are the commercial_registered_agents and id's. The graph were created using NetworkX.
