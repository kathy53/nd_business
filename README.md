Hi,

In this repo you can find the next two files: graph.png and result.csv. 

The CSV file cotains gathered data about North Dakota bussinesses.
The data correspond to all active companies whose names start with the letter "X". Be aware that the listed companies are more than 150 business but not all of them starts with "X".![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cacdacc2-d6c2-4d46-a1c5-b6235ee74b79)
 
The file contains the next columns: 
1. commercial_registered_agent
2. registered_agent
3. owners
4. id
5. status (allways active)

Also, I included a graph where the nodes are the commercial_registered_agents and id's. The graph were created using NetworkX.
Note that some of the id's actually share a commercial registered agent.
